# 🎯 Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the **recurrence risk** of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to support early diagnosis and personalized follow-up care by identifying patterns in patient data that are linked to cancer recurrence.

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Predict whether a thyroid cancer patient is at **risk of recurrence** after initial treatment.
- Build interpretable and accurate ML models to support **clinical decision-making**.
- Enhance the use of **AI in oncology** to reduce late detection and improve outcomes.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes anonymized clinical records of thyroid cancer patients with features such as:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Histologic Type**
- **Tumor Size**
- **Lymph Node Involvement**
- **Recurrence Status (Target Variable)**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation
- **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest** – classification algorithms

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📌 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handled missing values, normalized features, and encoded categorical variables.

- 📌 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualized trends (e.g., age distribution, tumor characteristics) to understand recurrence patterns.

- 📌 **Model Training**  
  Built and compared multiple supervised learning models.

- 📌 **Evaluation**  
  Achieved **>90% accuracy** in recurrence prediction with Random Forest classifier.

## 📈 Results

- The **Random Forest classifier** performed the best in predicting recurrence, achieving:  
  ✅ **91% Accuracy**  
  ✅ **90% Precision**  
  ✅ **92% Recall**  
  ✅ **91% F1-Score**

- The **Logistic Regression model** also showed strong performance with:  
  🔹 **87% Accuracy**  
  🔹 **85% Precision**  
  🔹 **86% Recall**  
  🔹 **85% F1-Score**

These results demonstrate the **effectiveness of tree-based models** in handling complex patterns in medical datasets and suggest that machine learning can play a key role in supporting clinical diagnostics.

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

This project showcases how **AI can assist in personalized medicine** by predicting recurrence risks in thyroid cancer patients. It may help reduce unnecessary procedures for low-risk individuals and prompt timely intervention for high-risk cases.
